# BibliotecaFEGA
<br/>
<p>A triple web project about the funcionality of a library. Keep in mind that the app is big and I can't explain all the workflow and funcionalities in a README file. For more information contact me in LinkedIn. I put my link at the description of GitHub profile. Below, I explain the tree applications.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Biblioteca FEGA Windows Form</h2>
<br/>
<p>This is the main app, it is developed in C# with Windows Form and Entity Framework. It is the app for the recepcionists of the library. In there, they can add authors, books, categories of books, add loans... It is a big app. Also, the user can configure certain parameters such the maximum time for return a book... His behaviour is similar to one single page app, cause it has an interface defined in every form and for every CRUD operations, refresh all opened MDIForms. Credits also to my teammate Antonio Garc√≠a as we developed the web both working at the same time with Azure Repository.</p>

<h2>Biblioteca FEGA UWP</h2>
<p>This is another app for the library developed using the new tools of UWP (Universal Windows Platform). It displays all of the books of the library per differents filters. His behaviour is perfect for being installed in a big tablet or PDA for the users of the library take a look to the books.</p>

<h2>Biblioteca FEGA ASP.NET</h2>
<p>Finally, we have an ASP.NET MVC web page. It is perfect for the final user (client). In it, they can view their lends of books, also see books of the library. It is perfect for upload in a web server and the users can see all of the library wherever they are.</p>
